# Kronotop

Kronotop is a distributed and transactional document database providing
an [MQL-like query language](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/). It utilizes
FoundationDB for its core transactional engine, storing document metadata and indexes within FDB to
ensure [ACID](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/developer-guide.html#transaction-basics) properties and reliable
replication for these critical components.

The actual document bodies are managed separately and stored directly in the local filesystem of Kronotop nodes. This
hybrid approach allows leveraging FDB's strengths for transactional metadata and index operations while enabling
potentially
different storage optimizations or replication strategies for the bulk document body data handled by the Kronotop nodes
themselves.

**Warning**: Kronotop is in its early stages of development. The API is unstable and likely to change in future
releases.

## At a glance

* Uses [RESP3](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/reference/protocol-spec/) as the wire protocol, so it is compatible
  with all Redis clients,
* Horizontally scalable and sharded by default,
* Supports *single* or *multi-master* cluster topologies for different deployment strategies and use cases,
* Partly
  supports [Redis cluster specification](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec/),
* Uses FoundationDB as the metadata store for cluster management and data structures,
* Implemented in Java and requires JDK 21+,

## What we have

Kronotop is still in its early stages, but we have the following features with a strong foundation.

* ZMap, an ordered key-value store. Simply, Redis protocol proxy for FoundationDB API,
* Namespaces for isolating ZMaps and Buckets, basically it's a thin layer around FoundationDB's directory layer,
* Volume, storage engine implementation with a primary-standby replication model,
* Clustering with single or multi-master deployment scenarios,
* Partial support for some Redis data structures: String and Hash.

## Plans for the foreseeable future

* Design and implement a data structure called **Bucket** to store JSON-like documents,
* **Bucket** data structure will support
  an [MQL-like query language](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/) and transactions backed by
  FoundationDB,
* Provide the most common Redis data structures such as String, Hash, Sorted Sets, etc.

## Getting started

It's easy to try Kronotop with Docker Compose:

```bash
curl -o kronotop-demo.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kronotop/kronotop/refs/heads/main/docker/kronotop-demo.yaml
```

Then, you can run the following command to create a single-member Kronotop cluster for demonstration purposes:

```bash
docker compose -f kronotop-demo.yaml up 
```

If everything goes okay, you should be able to connect to the primary node via `redis-cli`:

```
redis-cli -p 3320 -c
127.0.0.1:3320> PING
PONG
```

A cluster member serves from two ports:

* *5484* for the client communication,
* *3320* for the internal traffic and administrative commands.

### Initializing a Kronotop cluster

Before using Kronotop in your project, you first need to initialize the cluster. `KR.ADMIN INITIALIZE-CLUSTER` command
creates
the cluster's layout on the FoundationDB and initializes the cluster:

```
127.0.0.1:3320> KR.ADMIN INITIALIZE-CLUSTER
OK
```

Then, we must set the shard's primary ownership and make the shards operable. Currently, we only have a running Kronotop
instance in the cluster. It's good enough for demonstration purposes. We can assign all shards to this member.

First, we should run `KR.ADMIN DESCRIBE-MEMBER` command to learn id of the current member:

```
127.0.0.1:3320> KR.ADMIN DESCRIBE-MEMBER
1# member_id => a0dc14d811a285834c187ddc20549de7c1c1a381
2# status => RUNNING
3# process_id => AAAOz0CfYCoAAAAA
4# external_host => 127.0.0.1
5# external_port => (integer) 5484
6# internal_host => 127.0.0.1
7# internal_port => (integer) 3320
8# latest_heartbeat => (integer) 8227
```

We need `member_id` from this response. The following command sets the primary owner of all Redis shards;

```
127.0.0.1:3320> KR.ADMIN ROUTE SET PRIMARY REDIS * a0dc14d811a285834c187ddc20549de7c1c1a381
OK
```

Now we are ready to make our all Redis shards writable:

```
127.0.0.1:3320> KR.ADMIN SET-SHARD-STATUS REDIS * READWRITE
OK
```

If everything is okay, we can start using the newly formed Kronotop cluster:

```
redis-cli -p 5484 -c
127.0.0.1:5484> SET mykey "Hello"
OK
127.0.0.1:5484> GET mykey
"Hello"
```

All in-memory data will be persisted and replicated by the storage engine. See [Storage Engine](#storage-engine) section
for the details.

## Redis compatibility

Kronotop uses RESP3 as the client protocol. The reasoning behind this is simple: there are many high-quality Redis
client implementations
in all languages, and almost everyone has some experience with Redis.

Despite the main focus on building a transactional document database using FoundationDB as a metadata store,
implementing
the most common Redis data structures is on the roadmap. Currently, Kronotop has already partial support for *String*
and *Hash*
data structures.

## Features

### Transaction management

Kronotop exposes the FoundationDB API to Redis clients. This section explains transaction management commands.

*Note that not all parts of the FoundationDB API are implemented yet.*

#### BEGIN

`BEGIN` creates a new transaction and set it to the current session.

**Example:**

```
127.0.0.1:5484> BEGIN
OK
```

If there is another transaction in progress in the current session, it returns a `TRANSACTION` error message.

```
127.0.0.1:5484> BEGIN
(error) TRANSACTION there is already a transaction in progress.
```

#### COMMIT

`COMMIT` commits changes to the database.

**Example:**

```
127.0.0.1:5484> COMMIT
OK
```

FoundationDB currently does not support transactions running for over five seconds. If the transaction is too old,
it returns `TRANSACTIONOLD` error.

```
127.0.0.1:5484> COMMIT
(error) TRANSACTIONOLD transaction is too old to perform reads or be committed
```

If there is no transaction in progress in the current session, it returns `TRANSACTION` error.

```
127.0.0.1:5484> COMMIT
(error) TRANSACTION there is no transaction in progress.
```

#### ROLLBACK

`ROLLBACK` cancels the current session's in-progress transaction.

**Example:**

```
127.0.0.1:5484> ROLLBACK
OK
```

If no transaction is in progress in the current session, it returns a `TRANSACTION` error message.

```
127.0.0.1:5484> ROLLBACK
(error) TRANSACTION there is no transaction in progress.
```

#### GETAPPROXIMATESIZE

`GETAPPROXIMATESIZE` returns the approximated size of the commit, which is the summation of mutations, read conflict
ranges,
and write conflict ranges. This can be called multiple times before a transaction commit.

```
127.0.0.1:5484> GETAPPROXIMATESIZE
(integer) 619
```

#### GETREADVERSION

`GETREADVERSION` returns the version at which the reads for the in-progress transaction will access the database.

```
127.0.0.1:5484> GETREADVERSION
16275608010704
```

#### SNAPSHOTREAD

`SNAPSHOTREAD ON|OFF` enables or disables snapshot reads for the in-progess transaction.

In the FoundationDB context, snapshots a special-purpose, read-only view of the database. Reads done through this
interface
are known as "snapshot reads." Snapshot reads selectively relax FoundationDB's isolation property, reducing [Transaction
conflicts](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/developer-guide.html#conflict-ranges) but making reasoning about
concurrency harder. For more information about how to use snapshot reads correctly,
see Using [snapshot reads](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/developer-guide.html#snapshot-reads).

**Example:**

```
127.0.0.1:5484> SNAPSHOTREAD ON
OK
```

### ZMap

Kronotop also provides a new data structure called ZMap. ZMap is simply a RESP proxy for FoundationDB API.

FoundationDBâ€™s core data model is an ordered key-value store. Also known as an ordered associative array, map, or
dictionary,
this is a common data structure composed of a collection of key-value pairs in which all keys are unique. Starting with
this simple model,
an application can create higher-level data models by mapping their elements to individual keys and values.

See the [Data Modeling](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/data-modeling.html) section on FoundationDB documents.

**One-Off Transactions**

Kronotop will create a new transaction and automatically commit changes to the database for the ad-hoc commands.

In other terms, you do not need to do this for every command:

```
127.0.0.1:5484> BEGIN
OK
127.0.0.1:5484> ZSET mykey "Hello"
OK
127.0.0.1:5484> COMMIT
OK
```

One-off transaction feature is especially useful for running commands in CLI.

**ZMap and Namespaces**

A namespace prefixes all data stored in a ZMap. The current namespace can be inspected by running the following command:

```
127.0.0.1:5484> NAMESPACE CURRENT
global
```

`global` is the default namespace. Namespaces create isolation between data structures. This is how it works for ZMap

```
127.0.0.1:5484> NAMESPACE CURRENT
global
127.0.0.1:5484> ZSET mykey "Hello"
OK
127.0.0.1:5484> ZGET mykey
"Hello"
127.0.0.1:5484> NAMESPACE CREATE global.child-namespace
OK
127.0.0.1:5484> NAMESPACE USE global.child-namespace
OK
127.0.0.1:5484> ZGET mykey
(nil)
```

See [Namespaces](#namespaces) section for further information.

#### ZSET

`ZSET` sets the value for a given key. This will not affect the database until `COMMIT` is called.

**Example:**

```
127.0.0.1:5484> ZSET mykey "Hello"
OK
```

#### ZGET

`ZGET` gets a value from the database. The call will return `nil` if the key is not present in the database.

**Example:**

```
127.0.0.1:5484> ZGET mykey
"Hello"
```

#### ZGETKEY

`ZGETKEY` returns the key referenced by the specified `KeySelector`.

The default key selector is `FIRST_GREATER_OR_EQUAL`, `KEY_SELECTOR` portion of the command is optional.

Available key selectors:

* `FIRST_GREATER_OR_EQUAL`,
* `FIRST_GREATER_THAN`,
* `LAST_LESS_THAN`,
* `LAST_LESS_OR_EQUAL`

**Example:**

```
127.0.0.1:5484> zset key-0 value-0
OK
127.0.0.1:5484> zset key-1 value-1
OK
127.0.0.1:5484> zset key-2 value-2
OK
127.0.0.1:5484> zset key-3 value-3
OK
127.0.0.1:5484> ZGETKEY key-0 KEY_SELECTOR FIRST_GREATER_THAN
"key-1"
```

#### ZGETRANGE

`ZGETRANGE` gets an ordered range of keys and values from the database. The *begin* and *end* keys can be specified by
key selectors, with the begin `BEGIN_KEY_SELECTOR` inclusive and the end `END_KEY_SELECTOR` exclusive.

The default `BEGIN_KEY_SELECTOR` is `FIRST_GREATER_OR_EQUAL`.
The default `END_KEY_SELECTOR` is `FIRST_GREATER_THAN`.

Available key selectors:

* FIRST_GREATER_OR_EQUAL,
* FIRST_GREATER_THAN,
* LAST_LESS_THAN,
* LAST_LESS_OR_EQUAL

The key selector section of this command is optional.

**Example:***

```
127.0.0.1:5484> ZGETRANGE key-0 key-3
1) 1) "key-0"
   2) "value-0"
2) 1) "key-1"
   2) "value-1"
3) 1) "key-2"
   2) "value-2"
```

With `LIMIT` parameter:

```
127.0.0.1:5484> ZGETRANGE key-0 key-5 LIMIT 3
1) 1) "key-0"
   2) "value-0"
2) 1) "key-1"
   2) "value-1"
3) 1) "key-2"
   2) "value-2"
```

With `LIMIT` and `REVERSE` parameters:

```
127.0.0.1:5484> ZGETRANGE key-0 key-5 LIMIT 3 REVERSE
1) 1) "key-4"
   2) "value-4"
2) 1) "key-3"
   2) "value-3"
3) 1) "key-2"
   2) "value-2"
```

Range from beginning to end, get an ordered set or key/value pairs:

```
127.0.0.1:5484> ZGETRANGE * *
1) 1) "key-0"
   2) "value-0"
2) 1) "key-1"
   2) "value-1"
3) 1) "key-2"
   2) "value-2"
4) 1) "key-3"
   2) "value-3"
5) 1) "key-4"
   2) "value-4"
6) 1) "key-5"
   2) "value-5"
7) 1) "key-6"
   2) "value-6"
```

Explicitly using key selectors, please note that you can use the key selectors individually.

```
127.0.0.1:5484> ZGETRANGE key-2 key-5 BEGIN_KEY_SELECTOR FIRST_GREATER_THAN
1) 1) "key-3"
   2) "value-3"
2) 1) "key-4"
   2) "value-4"
```

#### ZGETRANGESIZE

`ZGETRANGESIZE` gets an estimate for the number of bytes stored in the given range.

```
127.0.0.1:5484> zgetrangesize key-0 key-9
(integer) 0
```

_FoundationDB says:_

> Note: the estimated size is calculated based on the sampling done by FDB server. The sampling algorithm works roughly
> in
> this way: the larger the key-value pair is, the more likely it would be sampled and the more accurate its sampled size
> would be.
> And due to that reason, it is recommended to use this API to query against large ranges for accuracy considerations.
> For a rough reference, if the returned size is larger than 3MB, one can consider the size to be accurate.

#### ZMUTATE

`ZMUTATE` runs an atomic operation on the given key.

Available mutation types:

* `ADD`: Performs an addition of little-endian integers.
* `APPEND_IF_FITS`: Appends param to the end of the existing value already in the database at the given key (or creates
  the key and sets the value to param if the key is empty).
* `BIT_AND`: Performs a bitwise and operation.
* `BIT_OR`: Performs a bitwise or operation.
* `BIT_XOR`: Performs a bitwise xor operation.
* `BYTE_MAX`: Performs lexicographic comparison of byte strings.
* `BYTE_MIN`: Performs lexicographic comparison of byte strings.
* `COMPARE_AND_CLEAR`: Performs an atomic compare and clear operation.
* `MAX`: Performs a little-endian comparison of byte strings.
* `MIN`: Performs a little-endian comparison of byte strings.
* `SET_VERSIONSTAMPED_KEY`: Transforms key using a versionstamp for the transaction.
* `SET_VERSIONSTAMPED_VALUE`: Transforms param using a versionstamp for the transaction.

**Example:**

```
127.0.0.1:5484> ZSET key-0 value-0
OK
127.0.0.1:5484> ZMUTATE key-0 value COMPARE_AND_CLEAR
OK
127.0.0.1:5484> ZGET key-0
"value-0"
127.0.0.1:5484> ZMUTATE key-0 value-0 COMPARE_AND_CLEAR
OK
127.0.0.1:5484> ZGET key-0
(nil)
```

#### ZDEL

`ZDEL` clears a given key from the database. This will not affect the database until `COMMIT` is called.

**Example:**

```
127.0.0.1:5484> ZDEL mykey
OK
```

#### ZDELRANGE

`ZDELRANGE` clears the keys in the given range. The *begin* is inclusive, *end* is exclusive.

**Example:**

```
127.0.0.1:5484> ZDELRANGE key-1 key-4
OK
127.0.0.1:5484> ZGETRANGE * *
1) 1) "key-0"
   2) "value-0"
2) 1) "key-4"
   2) "value-4"
3) 1) "key-5"
   2) "value-5"
4) 1) "key-6"
   2) "value-6"
```

Using `*` asterisk character to set a boundary:

Wipe out all keys in the current namespace:

```
127.0.0.1:5484> ZDELRANGE * *
OK
127.0.0.1:5484> ZGETRANGE * *
(empty array)
```

Clear all keys from the beginning to `key-3`:

```
127.0.0.1:5484> ZDELRANGE * key-3
OK
127.0.0.1:5484> ZGETRANGE * *
1) 1) "key-3"
   2) "value-3"
2) 1) "key-4"
   2) "value-4"
3) 1) "key-5"
   2) "value-5"
```

Clear all keys from `key-3` to end of the range:

```
127.0.0.1:5484> ZDELRANGE key-3 *
OK
127.0.0.1:5484> ZGETRANGE * *
1) 1) "key-0"
   2) "value-0"
2) 1) "key-1"
   2) "value-1"
3) 1) "key-2"
   2) "value-2"
```

### Namespaces

Namespace is a thin layer around FoundationDB's
powerful [directory](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/developer-guide.html#directories) concept. Namespaces are a
recommended approach for administering applications.
Each application should create or open at least one directory to manage its subspaces. Namespaces are identified by
hierarchical paths analogous to the paths in a Unix-like file system.

The hierarchy between directories is denoted by joining them with dot character. Let's assume that you have different
microservices and want to isolate their databases. You can create a namespace for each microservice under the
`production` namespace.

If you have three microservices named `users`, `orders` and `products`, your namespace hierarchy might look like the
following:

* `production.users`
* `production.orders`
* `production.products`

All data structures used by these namespaces will be isolated.

**Note:** Redis data structures are not stored under namespaces. Currently, namespaces cover only ZMap data structure.

#### NAMESPACE CREATE

`NAMESPACE CREATE` creates a new namespace with the given hierarchy.

**Example:**

```
127.0.0.1:5484> NAMESPACE CREATE global.users 
```

#### NAMESPACE REMOVE

`NAMESPACE REMOVE` removes the given namespace hierarchy. It's the equivalent of `DROP DATABASE` command in other
databases.
So you should be careful when start typing this command. The result is irreversible.

**Example:**

```
127.0.0.1:5484> NAMESPACE REMOVE global.users
OK 
```

You cannot remove the default namespace:

```
127.0.0.1:5484> NAMESPACE REMOVE global
(error) ERR Cannot remove the default namespace: 'global'
```

#### NAMESPACE CURRENT

`NAMESPACE CURRENT` command returns the current namespace in use for the session. The default namespace is in use if the
client doesn't set a different namespace by calling `NAMESPACE USE` command.

**Example:**

```
127.0.0.1:5484> NAMESPACE CURRENT
global 
```

#### NAMESPACE USE

`NAMESPACE USE` sets an existing namespace to be used by the session.

**Example:**

```
127.0.0.1:5484> NAMESPACE USE global.users
OK 
```

It returns `NOSUCHNAMESPACE` error if the namespace doesn't exist:

```
127.0.0.1:5484> namespace use global.clients
(error) NOSUCHNAMESPACE No such namespace: global.clients
```

#### NAMESPACE EXISTS

`NAMESPACE EXISTS` checks a namespace whether exists or not.

**Example:**

```
127.0.0.1:5484> NAMESPACE EXISTS global.users
(integer) 1
```

It returns `1` for existing namespaces and `0` for non-existing ones.

#### NAMESPACE LIST

`NAMESPACE LIST` lists the namespaces under the given hierarchy.

**Example:**

```
127.0.0.1:5484> NAMESPACE LIST
1) global
```

It can take an optional parameter of namespace hierarchy.

```
127.0.0.1:5484> NAMESPACE LIST global
1) users
```

It returns `NOSUCHNAMESPACE` error if the given hierarchy is invalid:

```
127.0.0.1:5484> NAMESPACE LIST global.clients
(error) NOSUCHNAMESPACE No such namespace: global.clients
```

#### NAMESPACE MOVE

`NAMESPACE MOVE` moves the rightmost namespace to another location in the given hierarchy.

**Example:**

```
127.0.0.1:5484> NAMESPACE MOVE global.users staging.users
OK
```

Let's check the result:

```
127.0.0.1:5484> NAMESPACE LIST global
(empty array)
127.0.0.1:5484> NAMESPACE LIST staging
1) users
```

## Management

This section defines commands to manage a Kronotop cluster and database sessions.

### Session

Kronotop provides a bunch of commands to manage database sessions. The following attributes are set by default:

| attribute  | type | scope  | description                             | default | available values |
|------------|------|--------|-----------------------------------------|---------|------------------|
| reply_type | enum | Bucket | Data interchange format for the replies | BSON    | BSON, JSON       |
| input_type | enum | Bucket | Data interchange format for the inputs  | BSON    | BSON, JSON       |

#### SESSION.ATTRIBUTE LIST

`SESSION.ATTRIBUTE LIST` lists all attributes with their current values used by the session. 

```
127.0.0.1:5484> SESSION.ATTRIBUTE LIST
1# reply-type => bson
2# input-type => bson
```

#### SESSION.ATTRIBUTE SET

`SESSION.ATTRIBUTE SET` sets a value to an attribute.

```
127.0.0.1:5484> SESSION.ATTRIBUTE SET reply-type JSON
OK
```

A random value cannot be set to an attribute, if its type is `enum`.

```
127.0.0.1:5484> SESSION.ATTRIBUTE SET reply-type some-value
(error) ERR Invalid reply type: some-value
```

It's not possible to set an attribute if it's not defined by Kronotop:

```
127.0.0.1:5484> SESSION.ATTRIBUTE set some-attribute value
(error) ERR Invalid session attribute: 'some-attribute'
```

## Storage Engine

Kronotop uses a custom-built storage engine named **Volume**. As the core persistence layer for this distributed,
transactional document store, *Volume* is responsible for reliably storing all document data on local disks and managing
data replication between cluster members.

### Design Philosophy and Architecture

*Volume*'s architecture strategically separates metadata management from the storage of the actual document content,
leveraging the strengths of different systems:

1. **Metadata Management (*FoundationDB*):** All metadata associated with the stored documents (referred to as entries)
   â€”such as
   their location within storage segments, versioning information, and replication statusâ€”is managed within a
   **FoundationDB** cluster. Leveraging *FoundationDB* provides Kronotop with strong `ACID` transactional guarantees for
   all metadata operations, crucial for maintaining consistency in a distributed environment.
2. **Document Content Storage (Local Disk):** The actual content of the documents/entries is stored efficiently on the
   local disk of each Kronotop node. This data is organized into large, pre-allocated files called **segments**.

#### Segments

Segments are the fundamental units for storing document data on disk:

* **Pre-allocation:** When needed, *Volume* creates segment files of a predetermined size on the filesystem.
* **Sequential Appends:** Document data is typically written sequentially into the latest active segment file.
  Internally, a segment can be viewed as a large byte array where new entry data is appended.

#### Document Append Workflow

When a new document or entry is saved via Kronotop, the *Volume* engine follows these precise steps to ensure atomicity
and durability:

1. **Request Handling:** *Volume* receives the request to store a new entry.
2. **Segment Selection:** It identifies the current active segment file designated for new data writes.
3. **Segment Lifecycle Management:**
    * If no segment is currently active (e.g., on node startup), *Volume* creates and pre-allocates a new segment file.
    * If the current active segment doesn't have enough contiguous space for the new entry, it's typically sealed (
      marked as read-only), and a new segment is created to become the active target.
4. **Data Persistence:** The segment component writes the entry's data into the appropriate location within the active
   segment file.
5. **Disk Synchronization (Flush):** A *flush* operation is executed against the modified segment file. This requests
   the operating system to write any buffered data to the physical storage, ensuring the entry's content is persistent
   on disk before proceeding.
6. **Transactional Metadata Commit:** Crucially, only *after* the disk *flush* confirms successful persistence of the
   entry's data does *Volume* commit the associated metadata (e.g., the entry's location within the segment) to the
   *FoundationDB* cluster. This commit happens within a single, atomic *FoundationDB* transaction.
7. **Identifier Return:** Upon a successful metadata commit, *Volume* returns unique identifiers for the stored entries,
   often based on *FoundationDB*'s versionstamps, providing a consistent system-wide order.

This two-phase process guarantees that the metadata stored transactionally in *FoundationDB* only ever points to
document data that has been safely persisted to disk.

### Replication

*Volume* includes an integrated system for **asynchronous replication** to maintain copies of the data on standby nodes,
enhancing fault tolerance and availability.

* **Change Log (*SegmentLog*):** When an entry is successfully stored on the primary node, *Volume* records this event
  by adding metadata to a specific data structure in *FoundationDB* called *SegmentLog*. This acts as an ordered log of
  data modifications.
* **Notification via Watches:** Standby nodes monitor for changes by using *FoundationDB*'
  s [watch mechanism](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/developer-guide.html#watches). They set watches on keys
  related to *SegmentLog*. When the primary updates this log, the watches trigger on the standbys, signaling that new
  data is available.
* **Data Synchronization:** Upon being triggered, a standby node fetches the actual document data from the primary
  node's segments corresponding to the new *SegmentLog* entries. This synchronization involves two phases:
    1. **Snapshot Phase:** Initially, or if significantly behind, the standby reads the *FoundationDB* history and
       systematically copies the required document data from the primary's segments until it reaches a reasonably
       current state. Data is often transferred in chunks.
    2. **Streaming Phase:** After the initial catch-up, the standby enters a streaming mode. It continuously watches for
       new *SegmentLog* entries and promptly fetches only the latest changes from the primary, maintaining low
       replication lag.

Kronotop also offers synchronous replication, but this functionality is provided through a distinct component, the
**Redis Volume Syncer**, which coordinates with *Volume*.

### Vacuuming (Space Reclamation)

Since segments are primarily append-based, space occupied by deleted or updated documents isn't immediately reclaimed.
*Volume* provides a **vacuuming** mechanism to manage disk usage.

* **Manual Initiation:** A system administrator can trigger the vacuuming process.
* **Background Operation:** Vacuuming runs as a background task to minimize the impact on live operations.
* **Process:** It involves scanning the *Volume* metadata within *FoundationDB* to identify segments containing a high
  proportion of "garbage" (space used by entries that are no longer valid or visible). If a segment's garbage ratio
  surpasses a defined threshold, the vacuuming process reorganizes the data, typically by copying the valid, live
  entries into new segments and then safely removing the old segment(s), thus reclaiming disk space.
