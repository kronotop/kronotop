# Kronotop Vision

## Introduction
Kronotop is an open-source, distributed, ACID-compliant document database designed to make it easier for developers to manage critical data reliably and at scale. Our goal is to make strong consistency accessible, while providing a system that feels natural to use with familiar development practices.

With a JSON-based document model, Kronotop offers flexibility, while multi-document ACID guarantees ensure consistency and durability. It is built to serve a wide range of use cases, from small projects to global deployments.

## Vision
We aim for Kronotop to become a trusted and practical choice among open-source distributed document databases for developers who need strong consistency at scale.

## Mission
To deliver a database that combines intuitive developer experience with strong consistency and horizontal scalability.

## Core Principles
1. **Consistency First** — Multi-document ACID transactions as a foundational feature.
2. **Horizontal Scalability** — Reliable operation from a single node to global clusters.
3. **Developer-Friendly** — A query language and data model that are easy to learn and use.
4. **Open & Transparent** — Licensed under Apache 2.0, with an open roadmap and community-driven development.  
   Everyone is welcome to contribute: [https://github.com/kronotop/kronotop](https://github.com/kronotop/kronotop)
5. **Operational Reliability** — Shaped by real-world experience and supported with strong operational tooling.

## Long-Term Goals
- **Technical Standardization** — Define a public query and protocol specification, with a conformance test suite.
- **Ecosystem Growth** — Provide SDKs, integrations, and migration tools for major programming languages and platforms.
- **Production Defaults** — Become the safe, obvious choice for new projects requiring a consistent, distributed document store.
- **Sustainability** — Support open-source development with enterprise services and managed solutions.

## Why This Matters
Modern applications require both **flexibility in development** and **reliable data management**. Kronotop brings these together, enabling developers to build applications that scale globally and remain correct under pressure.
