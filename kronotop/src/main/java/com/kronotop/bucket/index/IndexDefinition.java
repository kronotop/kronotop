/**
 * Represents the definition of an index used in the system. This definition includes the unique
 * identifier of the index, its name, the selector it targets, its sort order, and BSON type.
 * <p>
 * The IndexDefinition is designed as an immutable record and provides utility for creating a new
 * instance with an auto-generated identifier based on the name, as well as overrides for standard
 * Object methods like toString and hashCode.
 * <p>
 * Key Components:
 * - id: A unique identifier for the index, derived from the hash of the index name.
 * - name: The name of the index.
 * - selector: The selector associated with the index.
 * - bsonType: The BSON type of the selector being indexed.
 * <p>
 * The main usage scenarios include defining new indexes for a database and providing sufficient
 * metadata for index-related operations.
