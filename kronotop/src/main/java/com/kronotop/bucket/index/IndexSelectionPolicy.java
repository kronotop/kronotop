/**
 * Controls index selection filtering based on index status during retrieval operations.
 *
 * <p>This enum determines which indexes are accessible based on their current {@link IndexStatus}.
 * It's used by {@link IndexRegistry} to filter indexes according to caller requirements.
 *
 * <p><b>Policy Rules:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #READONLY}: Only {@link IndexStatus#READY} indexes (fully built and queryable)</li>
 *   <li>{@link #READWRITE}: {@link IndexStatus#WAITING}, {@link IndexStatus#BUILDING},
 *       or {@link IndexStatus#READY} indexes (actively maintained)</li>
 *   <li>{@link #ALL}: Any index regardless of status, including {@link IndexStatus#DROPPED}
 *       and {@link IndexStatus#FAILED}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Usage Context:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Query execution:</b> Use {@link #READONLY} to ensure stable, complete index data</li>
 *   <li><b>Write operations:</b> Use {@link #READWRITE} to maintain indexes during document changes</li>
 *   <li><b>Maintenance/admin:</b> Use {@link #ALL} to access any index for status checks or cleanup</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @see IndexRegistry#getIndex(String, IndexSelectionPolicy)
