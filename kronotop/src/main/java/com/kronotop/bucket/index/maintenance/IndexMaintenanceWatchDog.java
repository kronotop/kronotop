/**
 * Monitors and manages index maintenance tasks for a specific bucket shard.
 *
 * <p>This watchdog service continuously monitors the task queue for new index building
 * tasks and manages their execution lifecycle. It performs the following key functions:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Watches for new tasks using FoundationDB's watch mechanism</li>
 *   <li>Spawns worker threads to execute pending index building tasks</li>
 *   <li>Manages worker pool with backpressure control to prevent overload</li>
 *   <li>Cleans up stale or stuck workers that exceed the maximum stale period</li>
 *   <li>Coordinates task completion across shards using the task sweeper</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The watchdog implements a bounded worker pool strategy using {@link KrExecutors#newBoundedExecutor}:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Dynamic thread scaling from 0 to {@code WORKER_POOL_SIZE} threads (configurable via
 *       {@code bucket.index_maintenance.worker_pool_size}; defaults to number of CPU cores if set to 0)</li>
 *   <li>A maximum of {@code MAX_WORKER_POOL_SIZE} concurrent workers tracked in-memory (2x {@code WORKER_POOL_SIZE})</li>
 *   <li>LinkedBlockingQueue for task buffering when threads are busy</li>
 *   <li>1-minute thread keep-alive time for automatic thread cleanup during idle periods</li>
 *   <li>Automatic cleanup of stale workers that have been inactive for 60 seconds</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Task coordination across shards is handled through a completion counter.
 * When all shards report a task as completed, the watchdog triggers the
 * {@link IndexMaintenanceTaskSweeper} to finalize the index and clean up task data.
 *
 * <p>The watchdog runs continuously until the shard is closed, using both reactive
 * (watch-based) and proactive (scheduled) approaches to ensure timely task processing
 * and resource cleanup.
