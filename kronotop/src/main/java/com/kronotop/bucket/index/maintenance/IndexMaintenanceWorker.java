/**
 * Worker thread responsible for executing index maintenance tasks.
 *
 * <p>This class serves as the execution wrapper for index maintenance routines,
 * managing their lifecycle and coordinating with the watchdog service. Each worker:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Loads the task definition from FoundationDB</li>
 *   <li>Creates the appropriate maintenance routine (e.g., BackgroundIndexBuilderRoutine)</li>
 *   <li>Executes the routine with retry logic for transient failures</li>
 *   <li>Notifies the watchdog upon task completion via a callback hook</li>
 *   <li>Handles graceful shutdown when requested</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The worker implements a retry mechanism that continues execution until:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The task reaches a terminal state (COMPLETED, FAILED, STOPPED)</li>
 *   <li>The worker is explicitly shut down</li>
 *   <li>An unrecoverable error occurs</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Workers are managed by the {@link IndexMaintenanceWatchDog} which spawns them
 * for pending tasks and monitors their lifecycle. Upon completion, workers notify
 * the watchdog to remove them from the active worker pool and potentially spawn
 * new workers for other pending tasks.
