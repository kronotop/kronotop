/**
 * Executor responsible for performing document deletion operations in the Kronotop Cluster.
 *
 * <p>The DeleteExecutor processes a query pipeline to identify documents to be deleted,
 * then executes the actual deletion operations across multiple shards. It handles both
 * persisted entries and document locations by grouping them by shard ID and performing
 * volume deletion operations on each affected shard.
 *
 * <p>The execution process involves:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Executing the underlying pipeline to populate data sinks</li>
 *   <li>Extracting versionstamps from the populated sinks</li>
 *   <li>Grouping versionstamps by their associated shard ID</li>
 *   <li>Performing volume deletion operations for each shard</li>
 *   <li>Returning the list of all deleted document versionstamps</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>This executor supports deletion from two types of data sinks:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link PersistedEntrySink} - Contains complete document entries with metadata</li>
 *   <li>{@link DocumentLocationSink} - Contains document location information</li>
 * </ul>
