/**
 * MembershipService manages cluster membership, health monitoring, and failure detection in Kronotop.
 *
 * <p>This service is responsible for:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Member registration and lifecycle management (registration, updates, removal)</li>
 *   <li>Heartbeat generation and monitoring for liveness detection</li>
 *   <li>Failure detection using heartbeat timeouts</li>
 *   <li>Cluster event distribution (member join/leave events)</li>
 *   <li>Member status tracking (RUNNING, STOPPED, UNAVAILABLE)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Architecture:</b></p>
 * <p>The service uses three concurrent background tasks:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link HeartbeatTask}: Periodically updates this member's heartbeat timestamp in FoundationDB</li>
 *   <li>{@link FailureDetectionTask}: Monitors other members' heartbeats and marks them as dead/alive</li>
 *   <li>{@link ClusterEventsJournalWatcher}: Watches for cluster events (joins/leaves) and updates local state</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Failure Detection:</b></p>
 * <p>Members are considered dead if they fail to update their heartbeat within {@code heartbeat.maximum_silent_period}.
 * The failure detector tracks expected vs actual heartbeat counts and can detect both member failures and recoveries.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Thread Safety:</b></p>
 * <p>This service is thread-safe. Member views and subspaces are stored in concurrent maps and updated atomically.</p>
