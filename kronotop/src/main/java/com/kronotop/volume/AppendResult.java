     * and linked with the provided callback by leveraging the implementation of {@code getVersionstampedKeys}.

     * will result in an {@code IllegalStateException}.
     * - The internal processing relies on the completion of the associated {@code future}.
     * <p>
     * This method is typically used to synchronize the latest version-stamped keys with the provided cache
     * update mechanism.
