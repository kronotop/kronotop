/**
 * A {@code VersionstampedKeySelector} identifies a particular key in the database. FoundationDB's
 * lexicographically ordered data model permits finding keys based on their order (for
 * example, finding the first key in the database greater than a given key). Key selectors
 * represent a description of a key in the database that could be resolved to an actual
 * key by {@code Transaction}'s {@link Transaction#getKey(KeySelector) getKey()}
 * or used directly as the beginning or end of a range in {@code Transaction}'s
 * {@link Transaction#getRange(KeySelector, KeySelector) getRange()}.<br>
 * <br>
 * For more about how key selectors work in practice, see
 * <a href="/foundationdb/developer-guide.html#key-selectors" target="_blank">the VersionstampedKeySelector documentation</a>.
 * Note that the way the key selectors are resolved is somewhat non-intuitive, so
 * users who wish to use a key selector other than the default ones described below should
 * probably consult that documentation before proceeding.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * Generally one of the following static methods should be used to construct a {@code VersionstampedKeySelector}:
 * <ul><li>{@link #lastLessThan(Versionstamp) lastLessThan}</li>
 * <li>{@link #lastLessOrEqual(Versionstamp) lastLessOrEqual}</li>
 * <li>{@link #firstGreaterThan(Versionstamp) firstGreaterThan}</li>
 * <li>{@link #firstGreaterOrEqual(Versionstamp) firstGreaterOrEqual}</li></ul>
 * <br>
 * This is an <i>immutable</i> class.  The {@code add(int)} call does not
 *  modify internal state, but returns a new instance.
 * <br>
