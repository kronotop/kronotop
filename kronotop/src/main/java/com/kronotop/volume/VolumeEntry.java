/**
 * Represents a fully materialized entry in a Volume.
 * <p>
 * A {@code VolumeEntry} bundles together:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code key}: the logical address of the entry, expressed as a {@link Versionstamp},</li>
 *   <li>{@code entry}: the raw payload as stored in the volume,</li>
 *   <li>{@code metadata}: encoded {@code EntryMetadata} describing the physical layout
 *       (e.g., offset, length, checksum, or other volume-specific information).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This type is returned by {@code VolumeIterator}, which scans over the append-only
 * log segments of a shard and decodes each entry into its logical key, data, and
 * associated metadata. Consumers such as index builders, garbage collection, or
 * repair tasks can rely on {@code metadata} to make decisions that require knowledge
 * of the entryâ€™s physical representation.</p>
 *
 * <p>For simple read/write operations where metadata is not needed, higher-level APIs
 * may expose lighter abstractions (e.g., {@code KeyEntry}).</p>
